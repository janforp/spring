/**
 * Interface to be implemented by objects used within a {@link BeanFactory} which
 * are themselves factories for individual objects.
 *
 * If a bean implements this
 * interface, it is used as a factory for an object to expose, not directly as a
 * bean instance that will be exposed itself.
 * -- 如果Bean实现此接口，则它将用作对象公开的工厂，而不是直接用作将自身公开的Bean实例。
 *
 * <p><b>NB: A bean that implements this interface cannot be used as a normal bean.</b>
 * A FactoryBean is defined in a bean style, but the object exposed for bean
 * references ({@link #getObject()}) is always the object that it creates.
 *
 * <p>FactoryBeans can support singletons and prototypes, and can either create
 * objects lazily on demand or eagerly on startup. The {@link SmartFactoryBean}
 * interface allows for exposing more fine-grained behavioral metadata.
 *
 * <p>This interface is heavily used within the framework itself, for example for
 * the AOP {@link org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean} or the
 * {@link org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean}. It can be used for
 * custom components as well; however, this is only common for infrastructure code.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code FactoryBean} is a programmatic contract. Implementations are not
 * supposed to rely on annotation-driven injection or other reflective facilities.</b>
 * {@link #getObjectType()} {@link #getObject()} invocations may arrive early in the
 * bootstrap process, even ahead of any post-processor setup. If you need access to
 * other beans, implement {@link BeanFactoryAware} and obtain them programmatically.
 *
 * <p><b>The container is only responsible for managing the lifecycle of the FactoryBean
 * instance, not the lifecycle of the objects created by the FactoryBean.</b> Therefore,
 * a destroy method on an exposed bean object (such as {@link java.io.Closeable#close()}
 * will <i>not</i> be called automatically. Instead, a FactoryBean should implement
 * {@link DisposableBean} and delegate any such close call to the underlying object.
 *
 * <p>Finally, FactoryBean objects participate in the containing BeanFactory's
 * synchronization of bean creation. There is usually no need for internal
 * synchronization other than for purposes of lazy initialization within the
 * FactoryBean itself (or the like).

	 * FactoryBean 与 {@link BeanFactory} 的区别？!!!!!!
	 *
	 * 1.BeanFactory 是 Spring 的 IOC 工厂，它里面管理着Spring说创建出来的各种Bean对象，当我们在配置文件(注解)中声明了某个Bean的Id后，通过
	 * 这个id就能获取到与该id所对应的class对象实例（可能新建，可能从缓存获取）
	 * 2.FactoryBean本质上也是一个bean，它同其他bean一样，也是由BeanFactory所管理和维护，当然他的实例也会缓存到spring工厂(BeanFactory)中（如果是单例），
	 * 他与普通bean的唯一区别在于，当spring创建另一个FactoryBean实例后，他接下来会判断当前所创建的Bean是否是一个FactoryBean实例，如果不是，那么就直接将
	 * 创建出来的bean返回给客户端，如果是，那么他会对其进行进一步的处理，根据配置文件所配置的target,advisor,interfaces等信息，在运行期动态的构建出一个类，并且
	 * 生成该类的一个实例，最后将该实例返回给客户端，因此，我们在声明一个FactoryBean的时候，通过id获取的并非是这个FactoryBean的实例，而是他动态生成出来的一个代理对象
